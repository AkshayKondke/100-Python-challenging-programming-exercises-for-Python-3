## 🟢 Question 1: Find Numbers Divisible by 7 but Not 5

📌 **Level:** Beginner

### 🔍 Problem Statement:
Write a program that finds all numbers **divisible by 7 but not a multiple of 5** in the range **2000 to 3200 (both included)**.

📌 **Output Format:**
- The numbers should be printed as a **comma-separated sequence** on a single line.

💡 **Hint:**
- Consider using the `range(start, end)` function to iterate through the numbers efficiently.

## 🟢 Question 2: Compute Factorial of a Number

📌 **Level:** Beginner

### 🔍 Problem Statement:
Write a program that computes the **factorial** of a given number.

📌 **Example Input:**
```
8
```
📌 **Example Output:**
```
40320
```

📌 **Output Format:**
- The result should be printed as a **single integer value**.

💡 **Hint:**
- If the input is provided via the console, assume it to be a single integer.
- Factorial of a number `n` is calculated as `n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1`.

## 🟢 Question 3: Generate a Dictionary of Squares

📌 **Level:** Beginner

### 🔍 Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, write a program to generate a **dictionary** where the keys are numbers from `1` to `n` (both included) and the values are their **squares**.

📌 **Example Input:**
```
8
```
📌 **Example Output:**
```
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
```

📌 **Output Format:**
- Print the dictionary directly.

💡 **Hint:**
- If the input is provided via console, assume it is a single integer.
- Consider using `dict()` for dictionary creation.

## 🟢 Question 4: Convert Comma-Separated Input to List & Tuple  

📌 **Level:** Beginner  

### 🔍 Problem Statement:  
Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of **comma-separated numbers** from the console and generates:  
👉 A **list** containing all the numbers  
👉 A **tuple** containing all the numbers  

📌 **Example Input:**  
```
34,67,55,33,12,98
```

📌 **Expected Output:**  
```python
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
```

💡 **Hint:**  
- Use the `.split(',')` method to process the input efficiently.

# 📌 Challenge 5: Class-Based String Manipulation

**Difficulty Level:** 🟢 Beginner  

## 📝 Problem Statement
Create a Python class that performs basic string operations. Your class should include the following methods:

- **`getString(self)`** 📝: Accepts a string input from the user.
- **`printString(self)`** 🔠: Prints the stored string in **uppercase**.

Additionally, implement a simple **test function** to verify the class methods.

## 💡 Hints
- Use the `__init__` method to initialize any necessary attributes.
- Ensure that your class properly stores and retrieves the string input.
