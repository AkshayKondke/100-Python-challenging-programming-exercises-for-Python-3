# 📌 2D Array Generator

## 📖 Description
This project generates a 2-dimensional array based on user input values `X` and `Y`. The element at position `(i, j)` in the array is calculated as `i * j`.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- The program takes two integers `X` and `Y` as input in comma-separated format.
- It creates a 2D list where the value at `i-th` row and `j-th` column is `i * j`.
- Finally, the generated array is displayed.

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage
1. Run the Python script.
2. Input two numbers separated by a comma (e.g., `3,5`).
3. View the output 2D array.

## 📝 Example
### Input:
```
3,5
```
### Output:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
```
